# Heya! Hallöchen! Bonjour! Heisann!

My name is Maximilian Hellerforth, or simply Max for short. You might also know me as **Alyner** or **Alyner3**. I'm a half-French, half-German physics student (BSc) at the University of Münster. I've been passionate about computers and programming from a young age. I started learning to code at 13, and it's been a central part of my life ever since (including in my physics studies).<br/>

Speaking of physics: I'm especially interested in **computational methods**, **simulations**, and **materials physics**. Outside of that, I love learning languages. Right now I'm learning Norwegian (Bokmål), and it's a lot of fun!
