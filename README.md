<h1 align="center">Heya! Hallöchen! Bonjour! Heisann!</h1>

<p align="justify">
My name is Maximilian Hellerforth, or simply Max for short. You might also know me as <strong>Alyner</strong> or <strong>Alyner3</strong>. I'm a half-French, half-German physics student (BSc) at the University of Münster. I've been passionate about computers and programming from a young age. I started learning to code at 13, and it's been a central part of my life ever since (including in my physics studies).<br/><br/>
Speaking of physics: I'm especially interested in <strong>computational methods</strong>, <strong>simulations</strong>, and <strong>materials physics</strong>. Outside of that, I love learning languages. Right now I'm learning Norwegian (Bokmål), and it's a lot of fun!
